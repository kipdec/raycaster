## What is this?

This is a small project I undertook to get back into doing things with OpenGL. I used this tutorial as the basis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA

## What did I do outside of the tutorial

I have refactored the structure of the program quite a bit from the tutorial so that the components are properly separated, cleand up and built with a makefile. I also added a cool flashlight effect

## Requirements
- gcc
- glut
- OpenGL

## How to run

Simply type `make raycaster` in the root of this folder.
